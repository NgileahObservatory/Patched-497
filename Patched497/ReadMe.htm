<h1>ASCOM.LX90.Telescope Driver (C#)</h1>
<h2>Purpose of this documentation.</h2>
This documentation attempts to explain the features peculiar to the driver and the software architecture in the broadest possible terms. If you wish to build the driver and alter
the source code for yourself, you are directed to the <a href="https://github.com/NgileahObservatory/Patched-497" target="browser">GitHub repository</a> and the ASCOM project documentation for prerequisites
   (development tools and environment) <a href="http //ascom-standards.org/Developer/DriverImpl.htm" target="browser">ASCOM Driver Development</a>
<H2>Introduction.</H2>
Patches are available for Meade #497 handboxes. These add some new capabilities to
the Meade LX90 and Etx model telescopes. Stock ASCOM drivers know nothing of these
systems so this driver attempts to make features available via ASCOM that otherwise
would not be.<br/><br/>
Additionally the driver has some features such as setting the guide rate and compensating
for asymmetric time based movement of the scope particularly at sidereal and less rate.
These are a deliberate fudge around deficiencies in the mount when all else has failed.
E.g. You have critically balanced the scope and equal time slews at sidereal E/W yield
consistently different actual amounts of movement.<br/><br/>
<h2>Installation</h2>
Chicken and egg. Here you are reading these docs, which probably means you have run the installation executable: &quot;Patched497 Setup.exe&quot;. This installs and registers the driver
for use by ASCOM and ASCOM aware software.<br /><br />
The installation script is written for the Inno Setup Compiler. This produces the &quot;Patched497 Setup.exe&quot; that is run to install the driver.
<h2>Setup</h2>
   <p>
      <img src="docs/DriverSetup.png"/>
      <ol class="list-group">
         <li class="list-group-item">Com port. No searching of ports for a scope is made so set this yourself.</li><br />
         <li class="list-group-item">
            Guide Rate. Set whatever your guide rate ACTUALLY proves to be here if you can use the Meade Pulse Guide commands or custom guide rate you want if you intend to guide 
            with :RA#/:RE# commands on your mount. See the notes below about using Meade move commands and using this value to scale time at sidereal rate.
            Experimentally pulse guide commands on my LX90 yield a guide rate 0.5 × Sidereal. If you can only use the Meade move commands at sidereal, this value will be used to
            scale the time of the sidereal movements such that the mount behaves as if its guide rate is the value you specified here.
         </li><br/>
         <li class="list-group-item">
            This is where you can compensate for asymmetric guide slew performance. You may see this calibrating a guiding program like PHD/2 guiding for example.
            Fundamentally, equal time slewed E/W yields a different distance moved. The value entered here will scale the time of the slew in the direction selected (East/West)
            such that you should be able to obtain an equal distance slewed over time in each direction. Scale down not up. i.e. Scale such that a shorter guide pulse will move the
            same distance in the axis that moves greatest in a given time.
         </li><br />
         <li class="list-group-item">
            Check to indicate that you wish to use the HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL :RA#/:RE# features of a patched handset.
         </li><br />
         <li class="list-group-item">
            Indicate whether L/R or Up/Down reversal is required for the mount to slew in the correct direction for :RA# or :RE# commands. Internally the reality is that the rate is
            set and :Me#/:Mw# or :Mn#/:Ms# are issued as per normal. The L/R or Up/Down reversal is achieved by changing the sign of the :RA# or :RE# command. E.g. :RA-1.5# followed
            by :Mw# on my mount will move the mount at 1.5 degrees/sec W and correspondingly, :RA-1.5# followed by :Me# will move E at 1.5 degrees/sec. In that example, I need to always
            negate the rate for slews to move in the correct direction. Experiment with your mount. Make sure you have set any date/time, location, timezone, etc. you need to first.
            It turns out these can determine which reversals are required. Best do the necessary the first time than discover your mount going the wrong direction later.
         </li><br />
         <li class="list-group-item">
            Select how you want to pulse guide. This is also where the asymmetric guiding correction coefficient (overly fancy name for "fudge factor")
            is used to further scale the duration of the actual time spent moving in the given guide direction. Pulse guiding is not optional. Three algorithms are provided:<br /><br/>
            <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item"><i>Pulse guide commands.</i> Meade pulse guide commands are issued. On my LX90 these move the scope at an offset from sidereal of ± 0.5 × sidereal rate.
            i.e. The motor is always driving W, never stopped.
            Note, there is some funkiness around these commands especially if you have changed time zones or similar. I have seen the following behaviour:
            turn on the mount. Experiment with pulse guiding. Mount moves. Change timezone. Mount no longer responds to pulse guide commands. The problem appears to be a long
            standing bug in the Meade firmware. The mount can get its local sidereal time thoroughly wrong, toggling the time zone fixes this but can kill pulse guiding. Go figure.</li><br />
            <li class="list-group-item"><i>:RA#/:RE# at guide rate.</i> The driver issues the command to move the mount and to stop the slew in the direction requested when the pulse guide time
            is elapsed. Whatever arbitrary guide rate you set, the driver will issue :RA#/:RE# commands at that arbitrary rate. Experimentally using PHD/2
            and a guide pulse of 5000ms the following are the results at different guide rates:
            <ul class="list-group">
               <li class="list-group-item">1.0 × sidereal rate shows movement of 5 sidereal seconds (5 sec in RA). This is like the "Move commands at sidereal" below.</li>
               <li class="list-group-item">0.5 × sidereal rate shows between 2 and 3 sidereal seconds (2-3 sec in RA). i.e. Guiding is moving the scope at an offset from sidereal of ± 0.5 × sidereal rate.</li>
               <li class="list-group-item">0.25 × sidereal rate shows movement of approximately 1 sidereal seconds (1 sec in RA). i.e. Guiding is moving the scope at an offset from sidereal of ± 0.25 × sidereal rate.</li>
            </ul>
            </li><br />
            <li class="list-group-item"><i>Move commands at sidereal.</i> On my LX90 these move the scope at an offset from sidereal of ± 1.0 × sidereal rate. i.e. Guide W = 2 × sidereal. Guide E = motor stopped.
            The driver issues the command to move the mount and to stop the slew in the direction requested when the pulse guide time
            is elapsed. These are the classic Meade move commands at sidereal scaled by the guide rate. e.g. Specify a guide rate of 0.5 and pulse guide
            durations requested will be scaled by 0.5 such at a 1s guide pulse becomes a 0.5s move.<br /></li>
               </ul>
         </li><br />
         <li class="list-group-item">
            Focal length, aperture, secondary diameter and site elevation are required by ASCOM but not obtained from the mount. These are static values and should match your
            mount, OTA and site location.
         </li>
      </ol>

   <h2>SW Architecture.</h2>
The driver is implemented as a GoF state pattern. A single worker thread is responsible for
the servicing of a queue of operations. The operations are responsible for any state
changes on the axes. The GoF state pattern simply reduces invalid state transitions to 
NOP. i.e. The SW architecture has natural and simple semantics that ensure only operations
valid for any particular state are possible. All others do nothing.<br/><br/>
A side effect of this rigor is that the protocol for operating the driver is inflexible and
enforced. This will not suit all for sure, but the alternative is for example, to attempt
pulse guiding whilst slewing or some similarly nonsensical driving of the mount.<br/><br/>
State transition diagrams are provided for guidance.<br /><br />
Additionally, ASCOM has its own protocol and to work properly as an ASCOM driver, we must conform to the expectations of the ASCOM.Telescope interface. The state machine
enforces the expectations of the interface.
