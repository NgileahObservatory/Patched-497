# Patched-497

This driver is for use with patched Meade #497 HBX systems. Typically LX90 and ETX model telescopes.

It tries to compensate for deficiencies in these mounts and to make patch features accessible that would otherwise not be.

ASCOM Driver Development and prerequisites are found at <a href="http //ascom-standards.org/Developer/DriverImpl.htm" target="browser">ASCOM Driver Development</a>
I am far to lazy to repeat the instructions for setting up the development environment for ASCOM here when ASCOM have already done so with much
greater attention to detail elsewhere.

Documentation specific to this driver is found in the provided Readme.htm and comments throughout the source code.

The code should generally be thought of as highly experimental. The only test systems available to the developer (me) are a circa 2007 12" LX90 LNT,
and a similarly aged ETX 125.
